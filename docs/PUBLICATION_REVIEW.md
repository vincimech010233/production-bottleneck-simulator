# Publication review — 2026-10-12

VERIFIED: automated suites repeated for the original implementation commit f3f2564455b7d0bbcc834bb0c56524b04e5e1719, and documented examples executed again. Test logs and the current OSV dependency response are retained in `results/publication-gate-20261012.json`. Original failed attempts, inconclusive outcomes and dated local-delivery records remain in the repository.

OBSERVED: conservative credential/private-host-path scans covered every reachable Git blob. No matching secret/private-path patterns or included runtime environments were found. This is not exhaustive secret detection or a vulnerability-free assertion. Source code and license metadata were inspected; legal and supply-chain completeness remains NOT_VERIFIED.

A separate reviewing agent using the same model inspected code, documentation and history and repeated tests. It is a second internal review, not an externally independent audit. VERIFIED: reviewer decision is APPROVE within the retained project scope. The reviewer independently repeated Rust 7 + Python 1 + dashboard 2 tests, with no unresolved publication-blocking findings. Its recorded inspection and test logs are in `results/publication-reviewer-20261012.json` and `results/publication-reviewer-tests-20261012.json`.

Hosted CI is NOT_VERIFIED at the prepublication gate. The actual workflow result must be checked for the published commit. Current status can be inspected in this repository’s GitHub Actions page. Earlier NOT_VERIFIED CI statements describe the original local-delivery point in time.
